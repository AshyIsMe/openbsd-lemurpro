#+TITLE: OpenBSD on the System76 Lemur Pro


* Hardware

The Lemur Pro I have is a [[https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/lemp10/README.html][lemp10]] model configured with an i7-1165G7 and an extra 32GB Crucial ram stick in the single SODIMM slot
bringing the total up to 40GB ram. It shipped with a WDC 500GB nvme and I have put a Samsung 980 500GB nvme in the second slot.
The wifi card is an Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 removable card.
The lemp10 shipped with Coreboot which has a nice and simple interface which I only really use to select which nvme drive to boot (Pop!_OS or OpenBSD).
The keyboard and trackpad are pretty good and the build quality overall is pretty nice (not macbook quality but good enough).
It's a small lightweight laptop that feels similar in weight and size to my old macbook air 11" (2012) though the screen is much larger and nicer.

* Install process
The OpenBSD 6.9 install process was straight forward and as per the official documentation.

An issue at first was that the intel Tiger Lake onboard graphics are not supported on OpenBSD 6.9 and
will panic the kernel when attempting to startx.  This has been fixed sometime after the 6.9 release
however so updating to the latest snapshot allows xenocara to run and gnome works fine.

* Packages and configuration

Coming from linux the OpenBSD package manager is surprisingly slow.
A quick google shows that seems to be fairly well known but clearly not a big enough issue for the devs to spend
any time on it.
`doas pkg_add vim git emacs gnome gnome-extras ...`
